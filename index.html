    <div class="story-body" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="300">
      <p>The blonde girl in the hyacinth blouse wrinkled her nose. "I don't see much point in it," she said, punctuating it with a swig of beer.</p>
      <p>"You're telling me you grew up in Wyoming, and you don't see the point of a rodeo?" He asked her. His chaps hugged uncomfortably against his skin; they never seemed to sit right.</p>
      <p>"Just 'cause I was born and raised here doesn't mean I'm from here."</p>
      <p>"How cryptic."</p>
      <p>"Not really," she said flatly.</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl peeled the label from her bottle and he watched her hands. "So," she said, "why do you do it?"</p>
      <p>"You do realize I came over here to get your number, right? Not have a freakin' therapy session?"</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl laughed for the first time: balmy, tropical. She really wasn't from here. "Come on. What's the appeal?"</p>
      <p>"Fine. My dad always did. And his dad. It's what we do."</p>
      <p>"That it?"</p>
      <p>"Do I need another reason?"</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl shrugged. "Guess I don't really get doing something just for the sake of it."</p>
      <p>"Plenty of reasons. Tradition, camaraderie. Developing a skill and perfecting it."</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl nodded, staring off at the ring of stadium lights framing the rodeo, lifting bleachers out of the inky black night. "So you enjoy it?"</p>
      <p>"It's what I do."</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl and the boy stood in silence. A desert breeze lifted earth, dusting their boots. Trucks and horse trailers surrounded the rodeo; Indians circling a wagon train.</p>
      <p>"Well, my dad was an alcoholic," the hyacinth girl said suddenly. "Still is, I guess; says AA taught him he'll always be 'in recovery'." She drew quotes in the air with her fingers. "But that was way before I was born. Either way, no skin off my back."</p>
      <p>Some moments passed, and the loudspeakers mounted atop wooden poles dotting the area hummed the life, the announcers directing all contestants to their booths with tinmetal voices. "Good luck out there," the hyacinth girl said.</p>
      <p>Once at the rodeo grounds, the boy hopped the fence and spun slowly, taking in the palisade of iron fences and gates glinting in the harsh stadium lights, aberrations flicking across the railings with the jostle of cattle. He made his way to where the other contestants were, sitting at the end of the line and feeling the nervous energy course through them and into his stomach, like swallowing a live wire.</p>
      <p>Riders came and went and suddenly it was the boy's turn. Approaching the gate to mount the bull, he looked back at the hyacinth girl, but she had her head tilted back, draining another can.</p>
      <p>The bull charged out the gate, bucking, and the boy hadn't held on but for three seconds when he was bucked off entirely, slamming into the cratered earth. Pain ripped a crown around his skull. A thread of blood spooled out of his temple, singeing his hair crimson and running down his cheek, and the gift was accepted by God.</p>
      <p>The boy struggled to his feet and looked for the hyacinth girl. She met his eyes, then turned away.</p>

    <div class="story-body" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="300">
      <p>The air outside the tabernacle baked in the incandescent Louisiana sun. Dragonflies migrated across the field, hailing from the pond at the edge of the campgrounds, where reeds swayed and toads warmed their backs on rocks sequenced along the shore. We weren't allowed to approach the pond.</p>
      <p>My head ached listening to the tin-metal speakers mounted outside the tabernacle. It was more of the same.</p>
      <p>The evangelist shouted.</p>
      <p>The evangelist ran back and forth, sweat soaking through his teal polyester button down and binding to his skin.</p>
      <p>The evangelist spewed fire, and brimstone ricocheted through the crowd. The people found glory in their burns.</p>
      <p>I did not want to go back in to the tabernacle. I did not want to feel the still hot air pressing into my skin and see the deacons cast their lidded eyes back and forth across the congregation and I did not want to hold my feet close the fire.</p>
      <p>So I sat on the splintered wooden porch step outside the tabernacle, and I watched a warren of rabbits investigate a great oak that shook its limbs. I saw the metallic pools of mirage shimmer on the asphalt basketball court (such games strictly prohibited). I felt wet air tweak the tips of my bangs and curl the hair around my ears, interrupted by a breeze coasting off the pond and gracing my face. And I saw that it was good.</p>
      <p>The heavy white door fitted with rosy chapel glass scraped open behind me. I smelled him before I heard him: aftershave, sweat, and that peculiar disinfectant they spray on blazers at Goodwill.</p>
      <p>"Unless you're feeling sick, you ain't 'sposed to be out here. C'mon in. Get back to your seat and receive what the preacher is sayin'."</p>
      <p>I followed the deacon back inside the tabernacle.</p>

    <h2 class="story-title" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">CONSIDER THE RAVENS</h2>
    <div class="story-body" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="300">
      <p>The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between the two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay.</p>

<p>Or so I've read, anyway. I had never been there, but from a young age I felt an identity with it, a displaced heritage I imagine the child of immigrants might feel with their homeland. I remember the first time I felt it: late in the summer vacation before I started high school.</p>

<p>I sat with my father in the garage, both of us in green plastic lawn chairs. We sat opposite each other at a card table, pictures and Polaroids and undeveloped reels strewn about it, the shoebox they came from yawned open on the floor. My father pawed through each picture carefully, telling the story behind each. This box housed his formative years out west, from the time they first moved to Nevada when he was twelve years old, marrying my mom at nineteen, and then shipping off to Basic training a few months later.</p>

<p>"Just look at that," he said, sliding across a landscape shot like a blackjack dealer. The photo showed a crevassed, barren mountain dotted with little cactuses. A bright sun blazed above the mountain like an anointing. "This photo was taken on our way to one of our favorite camping spots. I wonder who took this one? Maybe Grant? Or Amos. Anyway, we'd set up at its base, and the mountain would shield us from the sun, and there was a little stream—can't see it in this picture—that ran south, and we'd fish from it and wash our clothes in it and we'd be out there for, man, what felt like <em>weeks</em> at a time."</p>

<p>I looked out across our trimmed, grassy front lawn. It was idyllic and dull. A pinwheel that my little cousin had stabbed into the mulch of our flower bed spun lazily.</p>

<p>"So why'd you and Mom settle in Ohio?" I asked.</p>

<p>My father shrugged. “Nevada was no place to raise a family. It wasn't even a particularly good place to live as a single person. It was more or less a dry wasteland with constant wind, a heat that beat you down in the summer, and a cold that dug into you in the winter. We lived far enough north of the Salinas Valley that winter still had its teeth."</p>

<p>"Then why do you love it so much?"</p>

<p>My father clasped his hands and leaned forward, resting his arms on his knees, and his pupils telescoped to something far beyond me. "When you go out west, and I mean really explore the west, not the tourist traps in Vegas or LA. . .something about it just gets into your bones and never leaves you, you know?" I did not know. "The world is so desolate and rugged there, everything stripped back to the minimum of what qualifies as Earth, and there's so much beauty and freedom in a blank canvas like that. But then you go down through the Salinas Valley and it's otherworldly, with its rows of green crops and soft winters and colorful landscapes. I love all of it."</p>

<p>We sat in silence for a few moments. My father drew on his cigarette, breathing out a cool blue cloud, and then stubbed it in the little crystalline ashtray. "I wish we had the money to go there now," he said suddenly. "Thirty years is too long to be away from home. And I want to show it to you." </p>

<p>"I would like that a lot," I said.</p>

<p>"Honestly," he continued, "I want to be buried out west when my time comes. That's not much to ask, right?” He tapped out another cigarette and brought it up to his mouth. He held it loosely between his lips, flicked a cheap Bic lighter, and shielded the limp flame from the garage’s cross breeze.</p>

<p><p class="section-break">§</p></p>

<p>Tom was most like his father. He was born in a fury and he lived in lightning.</p>

<p>"Steinbeck was a master of character," my father said when I read that excerpt to him. He had just given me a copy of <em>East of Eden</em> for Christmas; it was the one remaining Steinbeck novel neither of us had yet read. So, we promised to experience it together. Literature was the passion we shared.</p>

<p>"I’ll say. I think Ethan Hawley might be one of the best characters ever written," I gushed. Now in my sophomore year of high school, I was wading ever deeper into the stack of classics my homeroom teacher had lining the shelves. I was pleased to find she offered a number of Steinbeck books and had recently finished <em>The Winter of Our Discontent</em>.</p>

<p>"You know what else he excelled at?" my father asked me.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Description. The way Steinbeck describes the west, especially northern California, Nevada, and the Salinas Valley, is perfect. It captures my experience growing up there in a way no other writer has even approached."</p>

<p>"Is that why you re-read his books so often?" I asked. My father chuckled. "Yeah. I think that's part of it, anyway," he said.</p>

<p>"You know what?" I said. "We should buy all the Steinbeck books sometime. Stop borrowing them from the library and finally start that home library we've been talking about." </p>

<p>I watched my father weigh it in his head. "Money's been tight since I was laid off," he said.</p>

<p>"We can build the bookshelves, or thrift them, and if we buy used copies we can save a lot of money."</p>

<p>My father still looked doubtful. I pressed further. "We already had to cancel our trip out west. If these books are the closest you can get to going out west, isn't it worth it?"</p>

<p>He nodded slowly. "I really thought I could go back home this time around." He was silent again, turning over questions in his mind. "Okay," he finally said. "Let's work on that, then. That's our project for the next year: scavenging every Steinbeck book we can find and starting our own home library. We can swing this since we had to give up the trip. Really, that's not much to ask."</p>

<p><p class="section-break">§</p></p>

<p>Maybe we all have in us a secret pond where evil and ugly things germinate and grow strong.</p>

<p>And who in his mind has not probed the black water?</p>

<p>"Y'know, I've always thought that this would happen. Family history and all," my father lamented. He looked up at the ceiling. "Intuition or paranoia. . .I guess there's no difference when it happens." He looked at my sisters and me from across the dinner table, and my mom gently rubbed his back. "The doctor said it’d be a few blasts of radiation and some chemo. ‘Good as new,’ is what she said," he continued, drawing quotes around the doctor's words.</p>

<p>I cut into my pork tenderloin, stabbed a piece, then put my fork back down without taking the bite. Mosquitos tapped along the window screen, a slow July breeze drifting through the fine lattice. I could hear neighbors setting off fireworks down the road, the blasts reflecting off the hard thin walls of the mobile homes lined across the trailer park.</p>

<p>“In the New Testament, Jesus said that God is mindful to take care of even the ravens and sparrows, so how much more will He take care of us?” my mother suggested.</p>

<p>"That’s true. Thank you for reminding me of that verse," my father said, "Now, let's just enjoy dinner. Apparently the chemo will destroy my appetite, so who knows when I'll be able to eat with you all like this again?" He gave us a wan smile. "After all, having one normal dinner with my family before my life gets upended isn't much to ask. Now Shelly, will you say grace?"</p>

<p>We all joined hands.</p>

<p><p class="section-break">§</p></p>

<p>In the winter of wet years the streams of the Salinas Valley run full-freshet, and they swell the river until sometimes it rages and boils, bank full, and then it is a destroyer.</p>

<p>The cancer had metastasized, spreading from his esophagus to his lymph nodes, where his circulatory system distributed rogue cells throughout the organs, and the organs raged and boiled themselves, tumors warring over what few resources his body was still producing.</p>

<p>Calcium, phosphorus, potassium. There was never enough. A continual IV drip of all three barely allowed my father's body to break even, restoring just enough of his mental faculties to recognize who we were and not much past that. And when those nutrients depleted, then came the hallucinations, swift and strong: hooded people crawling across the walls, loved ones uttering hate, a robed bishop praying the rosary on a loop.</p>

<p class="section-break"><p>Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.<br>
At the hour of our death.<br>
At the hour of our death.</p>

<p>Seeing past us, my father described these things as they happened. Fearful eyes. Then the nurse would replenish his IV bags and he would finally fall asleep, silent until the bishop and the hooded people returned.</p>

<p>My father was in and out, home to hospital, hospital to home, like some cosmic toggle switch was being flipped back and forth. Finally, after his fourth visit to the ICU in as many weeks, he used his remaining faculties to make the decision to end treatments and go on hospice care. To spend what time he had left in his own bed, surrounded by his own people and belongings, with a soft lamp on and his stack of Miles Davis records playing—instead of the harsh fluorescents beating down and the ambient noise of IV drips and alarms—it was not much to ask for, he said.</p>

<p><p class="section-break">§</p></p>

<p>I had to carry him up the porch steps when we got home.</p>

<p><p class="section-break">§</p></p>

<p>Our living room smelled antiseptic and plastic and hard. Packages of medical supplies were stacked on the coffee table that had been unceremoniously shoved into a far corner. My father lay on a brown steel-framed bed that the home health aides had wheeled into our living room. We had to rearrange the furniture to accommodate the bed, so the sofas and recliners were in a crescent around the bed like it was an altar. The aides joked with each other as they assembled the bed. I've often wondered since how long it had taken them to become desensitized to what they did for a living, and if they were cognizant of how these forgettable moments in their lives marked the signposts in someone else’s.</p>

<p>I helped one of the hospice nurses pick my father up and place him on the bed, then I held him on his side as she pricked him with a long thin syringe and injected twenty milligrams of morphine into his collapsing veins and the flow of blood carried it throughout his body and muted his pain and muted him in turn and finally he lay still and peaceful for what felt like the first time in a century and maybe now my own brain would be quiet too but it wasn’t and all I felt was the same roar that had kicked up the moment the terrible thing surfaced the black water and I couldn't stop it and I couldn't face it and all I could do was focus on the next, the next moment the next need the next pain the next nothing the next</p>

<p>My mother buried her face in my sister's shoulder.</p>

<p>The hospice nurse and home health aides left, set to return in the morning, and together we were each alone.</p>

<p>"We should go call Grandma," my sister said. "Will you stay in here with Dad?" she asked me. I nodded. As I listened to their footsteps cross the house, I saw my bookmark poking out of the top of my bag. I had been carrying my copy of East of Eden with me for a few weeks like a charm. Feeling the weight of it in my backpack grounded me as I oscillated between home and hospital. I picked the book up and flipped through the pages. Neither my father nor I had been able to finish the book before his treatments started, and then life was too chaotic to make time for reading.</p>

<p>My father stirred, blinked a few times, and looked at me. Recognition arced across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hey Dad," I said. He offered a weak wave, just two fingers raised, limp arms at his sides. His face had hollowed out from the weight he lost, and sweat trickled down his face and carved the sunken pit of his cheek, running down to the crisp white pillow that drank in the stain.</p>

<p>Over the past few months as one of my father's primary caretakers, I had developed an intuition for what he wanted even when he wasn't able to articulate it. This time I sensed that he wanted me to keep talking, but I had run out of my own words.</p>

<p>"Dad, I'm going to read to you, okay?"</p>

<p>He gave a single small nod.</p>

<p>I opened the pages holding the bookmark to pick up the story where we left off, but then I thought for a moment and flipped back to the beginning.</p>

<p>The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay. I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers.</p>

<em>Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?</em></p>

<p>Reverend Emery read the scripture aloud as he delivered the eulogy at my father's funeral. Middle-aged, Emery had kind and sad eyes, an unassuming posture, and a folksy, disarming voice that lowered your walls when he spoke to you. He was a man who thought carefully and felt deeply.</p>

<p>"So, as we close the service,” Emery said, “I want to encourage the Hall family to remember this scripture as the children mourn the loss of their father, and Mrs. Hall, her husband. Remember, folks, God will take care of you. Trust Him in things great and little."</p>

<p>As Emery said the closing prayer, I couldn't help but ask God why He didn't let my dad see the west one more time.</p>

<p>After all, that's not much to ask.</p>

    <p>You drew back your cue and shot, rolling the scuffed white ball across the green felt. It reflected off a corner and pocketed an eight ball, and I listened to it roll back home.</p>

    <p>That shot, I said, was the kind he would have made. You slipped chalk on the end of your cue.</p>

    <p>I remembered that it had been over a year since he died, and maybe that meant something. But it made no difference. That day felt like the day before and the one before that. It was only through the duration of months that we were able to look back and see the days accumulate into a ray of light. Grief is a gradient, as my counselor said, and you can only see the shift when you take a step back.</p>

    <p>Marie, I said, we have to see the good. You maintained that April is the cruellest month. Quoting T.S Eliot is another thing he’d do, I thought to myself.</p>

    <p>More months passed, and the days lightened further, buoying us up. We took and lost jobs, we dated and broke hearts, we took shots and missed. The one constant was every weekend we’d stalk the table, spinning balls across it, plotting intricate geometries. The stakes ended with the game, and someone always came out a victor, and when one of us won, we both did. And after our ritual, we’d hang up our poles and compare the shades of light that gradually scrolled our lives into entirely new gradients.</p>

    <p>And our lives kept scrolling. Isaiah lost his job. But each rejection is redirection. Our parents divorced. Better late than never to live a truth. I carried on, punching my timecard to lay rubber at the plant. And you continued teaching, seeing each class move on while you delivered the same curriculum to a new crop. I told you about how I exceeded production quotas that got me a gift card and a promise of promotion, and you told me about the little girl in your charge who learned to read Braille after her accident. We helped each other let the light in.</p>

    <p>Summer surprised us. The diagnosis was a refrain. But it's only Hodgkin's, you said, and she’s only in stage II. I nodded along.</p>

    <p>Another week rose up, and another after that.<br>
    We traded little glories.<br>
    And braced for another day in the vise.</p>
