    <div class="story-body" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="300">
      <p>The blonde girl in the hyacinth blouse wrinkled her nose. "I don't see much point in it," she said, punctuating it with a swig of beer.</p>
      <p>"You're telling me you grew up in Wyoming, and you don't see the point of a rodeo?" He asked her. His chaps hugged uncomfortably against his skin; they never seemed to sit right.</p>
      <p>"Just 'cause I was born and raised here doesn't mean I'm from here."</p>
      <p>"How cryptic."</p>
      <p>"Not really," she said flatly.</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl peeled the label from her bottle and he watched her hands. "So," she said, "why do you do it?"</p>
      <p>"You do realize I came over here to get your number, right? Not have a freakin' therapy session?"</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl laughed for the first time: balmy, tropical. She really wasn't from here. "Come on. What's the appeal?"</p>
      <p>"Fine. My dad always did. And his dad. It's what we do."</p>
      <p>"That it?"</p>
      <p>"Do I need another reason?"</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl shrugged. "Guess I don't really get doing something just for the sake of it."</p>
      <p>"Plenty of reasons. Tradition, camaraderie. Developing a skill and perfecting it."</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl nodded, staring off at the ring of stadium lights framing the rodeo, lifting bleachers out of the inky black night. "So you enjoy it?"</p>
      <p>"It's what I do."</p>
      <p>The hyacinth girl and the boy stood in silence. A desert breeze lifted earth, dusting their boots. Trucks and horse trailers surrounded the rodeo; Indians circling a wagon train.</p>
      <p>"Well, my dad was an alcoholic," the hyacinth girl said suddenly. "Still is, I guess; says AA taught him he'll always be 'in recovery'." She drew quotes in the air with her fingers. "But that was way before I was born. Either way, no skin off my back."</p>
      <p>Some moments passed, and the loudspeakers mounted atop wooden poles dotting the area hummed the life, the announcers directing all contestants to their booths with tinmetal voices. "Good luck out there," the hyacinth girl said.</p>
      <p>Once at the rodeo grounds, the boy hopped the fence and spun slowly, taking in the palisade of iron fences and gates glinting in the harsh stadium lights, aberrations flicking across the railings with the jostle of cattle. He made his way to where the other contestants were, sitting at the end of the line and feeling the nervous energy course through them and into his stomach, like swallowing a live wire.</p>
      <p>Riders came and went and suddenly it was the boy's turn. Approaching the gate to mount the bull, he looked back at the hyacinth girl, but she had her head tilted back, draining another can.</p>
      <p>The bull charged out the gate, bucking, and the boy hadn't held on but for three seconds when he was bucked off entirely, slamming into the cratered earth. Pain ripped a crown around his skull. A thread of blood spooled out of his temple, singeing his hair crimson and running down his cheek, and the gift was accepted by God.</p>
      <p>The boy struggled to his feet and looked for the hyacinth girl. She met his eyes, then turned away.</p>

    <div class="story-body" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="300">
      <p>The air outside the tabernacle baked in the incandescent Louisiana sun. Dragonflies migrated across the field, hailing from the pond at the edge of the campgrounds, where reeds swayed and toads warmed their backs on rocks sequenced along the shore. We weren't allowed to approach the pond.</p>
      <p>My head ached listening to the tin-metal speakers mounted outside the tabernacle. It was more of the same.</p>
      <p>The evangelist shouted.</p>
      <p>The evangelist ran back and forth, sweat soaking through his teal polyester button down and binding to his skin.</p>
      <p>The evangelist spewed fire, and brimstone ricocheted through the crowd. The people found glory in their burns.</p>
      <p>I did not want to go back in to the tabernacle. I did not want to feel the still hot air pressing into my skin and see the deacons cast their lidded eyes back and forth across the congregation and I did not want to hold my feet close the fire.</p>
      <p>So I sat on the splintered wooden porch step outside the tabernacle, and I watched a warren of rabbits investigate a great oak that shook its limbs. I saw the metallic pools of mirage shimmer on the asphalt basketball court (such games strictly prohibited). I felt wet air tweak the tips of my bangs and curl the hair around my ears, interrupted by a breeze coasting off the pond and gracing my face. And I saw that it was good.</p>
      <p>The heavy white door fitted with rosy chapel glass scraped open behind me. I smelled him before I heard him: aftershave, sweat, and that peculiar disinfectant they spray on blazers at Goodwill.</p>
      <p>"Unless you're feeling sick, you ain't 'sposed to be out here. C'mon in. Get back to your seat and receive what the preacher is sayin'."</p>
      <p>I followed the deacon back inside the tabernacle.</p>

    <div class="story-body" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="300">
      <p>Dear Iris,</p>

<p>You made the news again.</p>

<p>I saw the story while I was sitting in the laundromat last week. Mom asked me to help out more, so I've been washing our clothes there to get out of the house. It's the same one she used to take you, me, and Leo to, on the edge of town, where we'd dash around the pine trees in the field behind the building and beg her for spare quarters to buy caramel popcorn from the vending machine. Looking back, it's a wonder we didn't have more cavities as kids.</p>

<p>According to the story, NASA launched some sort of probe they call Juno, which basically looks like a cyberpunk windmill, to go scout out the north and south poles of Jupiter. They want to skim the surface, learn how the planet was shaped and how its magnetic fields have flipped this way and that over time, and how its eternal storms keep raging. But what they didn't expect were the sprites. The scientist they were interviewing said that they detected flashes of light that phosphoresce over the sky, visible for a split second even from space. These flashes are so sun-bright and brilliant, but transient, gone as quick as they come. So the scientists have started calling them "Jupiter's fairies." Jupiter's fairies. I liked that. It made me think of you.</p>

<p>You know, right before you left, I had been applying to colleges and was about to start my first job. I had that science scholarship, but it wouldn't cover all the costs of living at the dorms, so I'd have to work as well. When I saw the story about Jupiter's fairies, I almost had half a mind to go back to school for astronomy. I knew you would have loved that. Maybe I could convince the foundation to make an exception, waive the age limit and reward me the scholarship again. Then maybe I could get that degree. God knows I haven't done anything else with my life. Do you remember how Dad used to always tell us we'd own the world? Hardly. But I know you would have.</p>

<p>When I logged onto my computer to look up the foundation, I found myself watching, again, the clips from the first time you made the news, after I found you floating in the pool under a slate sky, red ferns feathering across your skin. But when I watched the clips this time, it dawned on me that had I been more decisive—put my foot down when you said you wanted to try swimming in the rain, when Mom and Dad were with Grandma Jean and weren't there to stop you, and how Alison from school once did and she said it was so much fun—had I been more decisive, you'd still be here, and it wouldn't have mattered that the rain gave way to lightning. And I thought about how all I've ever been since then is paralyzed. Even Leo's already married and moved out; he's an accountant over in Casper, but here I am, in my old bedroom, nothing to call my own.</p>

<p>I guess that's what spurred me to write this note. For the first time in my life, I'm being decisive.</p>

<p>I hope the storms on Jupiter are kinder to us than the ones here have been.</p>

<p>See you soon,</p>
<p>Your big brother, Felix</p>

    <p>You drew back your cue and shot, rolling the scuffed white ball across the green felt. It reflected off a corner and pocketed an eight ball, and I listened to it roll back home.</p>

    <p>That shot, I said, was the kind he would have made. You slipped chalk on the end of your cue.</p>

    <p>I remembered that it had been over a year since he died, and maybe that meant something. But it made no difference. That day felt like the day before and the one before that. It was only through the duration of months that we were able to look back and see the days accumulate into a ray of light. Grief is a gradient, as my counselor said, and you can only see the shift when you take a step back.</p>

    <p>Marie, I said, we have to see the good. You maintained that April is the cruellest month. Quoting T.S Eliot is another thing he’d do, I thought to myself.</p>

    <p>More months passed, and the days lightened further, buoying us up. We took and lost jobs, we dated and broke hearts, we took shots and missed. The one constant was every weekend we’d stalk the table, spinning balls across it, plotting intricate geometries. The stakes ended with the game, and someone always came out a victor, and when one of us won, we both did. And after our ritual, we’d hang up our poles and compare the shades of light that gradually scrolled our lives into entirely new gradients.</p>

    <p>And our lives kept scrolling. Isaiah lost his job. But each rejection is redirection. Our parents divorced. Better late than never to live a truth. I carried on, punching my timecard to lay rubber at the plant. And you continued teaching, seeing each class move on while you delivered the same curriculum to a new crop. I told you about how I exceeded production quotas that got me a gift card and a promise of promotion, and you told me about the little girl in your charge who learned to read Braille after her accident. We helped each other let the light in.</p>

    <p>Summer surprised us. The diagnosis was a refrain. But it's only Hodgkin's, you said, and she’s only in stage II. I nodded along.</p>

    <p>Another week rose up, and another after that.<br>
    We traded little glories.<br>
    And braced for another day in the vise.</p>
